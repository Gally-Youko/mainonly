# mainonly
a js bookmarklet to remove all elements from a page except the one you want to focus on

(created using gpt-4-turbo-1106, with some manual tweaking.)

## How to use
1. Open the ["minified.js" file](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/jerrylususu/mainonly/main/minified.js), copy all the content in it (Ctrl+A), and create a bookmark with the content as url.
2. On a webpage, first click the bookmark, then select the element you want to focus on. (a red outline will be shown around it.) Scroll to expand or shrink selection.
3. After a selection has been made, left click, and all the other elements are now hidden.
4. Press `ESC` to recover the hidden elements and restore the page as before.
